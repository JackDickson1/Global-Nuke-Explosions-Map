# Global Nuclear Explosions Map

### Discription
    This website displays information about the worlds nuclear epxlosion test sites. 
    It uses leaflet to create the basemap and add features to the map. 
    There are pop ups when you click on a circle that show you some informaion about the explosion. 

### Application Purpose
    The purpsoe of this application is to provide spatial infomaton using locaion of 
    nucalear test sites around the world. Pop ups on the explosion circles display the 
    country / test name, the yield of the explosion in tonnes, and the purpose of the 
    test / explosion.  

### Symbolization and Design
    Symbols for the sites are scaled circles that increase in size with yeild of the explosions. 
    I converted the yeilds into tonnes only so that I could display them in using the circles. 
    Previously they were displayed in t, kt, mt. I chose to go with a orange/red color scheme over 
    a simple black and white basemap. I think that this makes the circles stand out. I also used 
    opacity to allow the user to see through the circles. There are many circles that overlap so 
    the opacity is helpful when navigating the map. 

### Data Source
    The data source used in this map is a ArcGIS Online feature layer created by Damian Spangrud. 
    The basemap is from Stadia Maps.
